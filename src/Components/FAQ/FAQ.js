        <h1 className = 'question'>Why does shipping cost so much? </h1>
        <p className = 'answer'>
          Excellent question! As we are shipping live animals, 
          the only method we us is Next-Day Priority shipping. 
          If multiple animals are being sent, we will package
          in the same box for easier shipping.
